# Data Visualization with Tableau (Project)

## Project/Goals
The goal is to create visualizations based on data from the Canadian Open Data portal thoughout various years, such as weekly earnings, housing constructions, house prices, housing price index, office real estate index and consumer index.
These visualizations will be used to satisfy requirements of various questions.


## Process
- Connect the data sources to the project - this includes .csv, .json and .xslx files.
- Establish relationships/joins
- Establish a visual for necessary data
- Create dashboards for summary
- Summarize findings
- Challenges


## Results
- The trend after 2005 with actual benchmark prices sees the average benchmark price increaseing quicker than the overall housing price index.
- Using the housing price index to compare with the office prices, the office prices are getting more expensive faster than the housing prices are, however not by a significant amount as indicated by the trend lines.
- Average prices across Canada have increased significantly across the years and the price differences between the different districts are increasing as well, with some prairie provinces actually decreasing while other large urban centers increasing at a drastic pace (i.e. Vancouver & Toronto)
- After adjusting for inflation, people spent more of their money in 2014 than in 2001 when factoring in both the housing price index (HPI) and the consumer price index (CPI).
- Earnings, house prices, office prices, house constructions and consumer index changes can be seen in significant downturn years like the early 1990s recession, dot com bubble (2000-2002) and the financial crisis (2007-2009). In times of economic crisis like the ones stated, most of these metrics show a decrease across the board.
- Lastly, looking at the trend of the CPI and the HPI throughout the history, we can generally predict CPI from the HPI.

## Challenges 
- I spent way too much time overthinking and interpreting the questions as they seemed very open ended. 
- Understanding which tables need to be joined and what data to use was difficult.
- Selecting the proper visualizations for each. I used line graphs as I felt they were best fit to show trends.
- Compiling via Tableau Public was not a smooth process, making it an infficient use of time to compile presentation.
- I had issues converting the data from .json to .csv, so I found the database and pulled the information for weekly earnings via the web in .csv form.

## Future Goals
- Ensure all the charts/graphs align with each other (filters on dashboards link properly)
- Match units for a better apples-to-apples comparison (e.g. units of measurement, indices, etcâ€¦)
- Use different variations of graphs
- Identity specific points/trends on the visual to tell a better story
- Explore using Tableau Story
